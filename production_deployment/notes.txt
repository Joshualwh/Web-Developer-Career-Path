Deploying Our Files:
  1) Use Heroku to have another server.
  2) Backend code on a computer dedicated as a server.
  3) AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc.
  4) Deploy node code to Heroku.
  5) Production to Deployment: Move code from our computer to another computer that are dedicated.

Code Review:
  1) Your code can always be improved!

Security Review:
  1) Need to have a few layers of validation.
  2) Server never trusts anything received from the front end, do it's own validation.

Optional: Using gRPC API:
  1) REST to gRPC API is a drastic change.
  2) gRPC is quite rare to see.
  3) gRPC: Google Remote Procedure Call.
    - Faster way.
  4) REST universal support.

Environment Variables:
  1) The server that is running on has it's own variables.
  2) Inject those variables into specific places within a file.
  3) In bash:
    PORT=3000 node server.js
  4) Important for things that should be kept secret.
  5) In fish:
    env DATABASE_URL='hello' node server.js

Alternatives to Heroku:
  1) Read documentation of the service you want to use.
  2) Use their dashboard to deploy your app.
  3) Frontend:
    - Github Pages
    - Netlify
  4) Backend/Database:
    - https://fly.io/
    - https://render.com
    - https://railway.app
    - https://cyclic.sh
    - https://supabase.com/

Deploying On Heroku:
  1) DevOps focuses on this domain.
  2) Don't put anything sensitive in the code base. Put it in environment variable.
