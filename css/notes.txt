Your First CSS:
  1) Head contains information what the page needs.
  2) Cascading Style Sheets.
  3) Cascading: Takes last input.
  4) There are total 3 ways to incorporate styles into HTML.
    - Normal way (best way): 
      - In <head>
      - <link rel="stylesheet" href="style2.css">
      - Separation of concerns.
    - Inline element: 
      - <header style="background-color: aliceblue;">
    - In <head>:
      - <style>
          li {
            background-color: purple;
          }
        </style>
      - We don't do this because it may become difficult to maintain.

CSS Properties:
  1) Properties: Properties that we want to change within a web page.
  2) rgb and rgba:
    - rgba, a stands for alpha, sets the opacity. 0 - 1.
  
CSS Selectors:
  1) Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level indicates that the order of CSS rules matter.
  2) ID is similar to class but can only use once.
  3) * not used very often, symbolizes all elements.
  4) element1 element2 {}:
    - Select all element2 that are inside element1.
  5) element1 > element2 {}:
    - Select all element2 that have parent of element1.
  6) element1 + element2 {}:
    - Select any element2 that is exactly after an element1.
  7) p:hover {}:
    - It is default but change when hovered upon.
  8) .webtext:last-child {}
  9) .webtext:first-child {}
  10) What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
      -Specificity
      -Importance
      -Source Order
  11) Specificity calculator.

Text and Font:
  1) Fonts are information that each computer has but not equally distributed amongst everybody.
  2) Google Fonts.

px vs em vs rem:
  1) em: We want the font size to be 5 times the containing element.
  2) rem: In relation to the root element.
